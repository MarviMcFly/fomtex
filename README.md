# fomTex
fomTex will provide various LaTex templates for various papers according to the requirements of the FOM University of Applied Sciences (FOM).

# Project structure
On the top level, there are always different types, such as scientific paper. After that you will find directly the corresponding LaTex files to build a work on it.

# How to contribute
Contributing to this project is pretty simple. First of all, the **main** branch must be in a **releasable state**. Therefore, contributing starts with creating a new branch. The branch must be named according to the type of template, e.g. *scientific_paper*. If it refers to an issue, the issue number is prepended. All other relations must be mentioned in a meaningful way.
